++During day 2 we learned about the Control Structures:

- Sequential structure: The default (structure).
- Conditional structure: The decision-making statements.
- Repetition structure: The looping statements.

++We showed simple examples for each structure.

++Then, we moved to Python functions:
- Default Parameters.
- Variable Scope.
- Docstrings.
- Arbitrary Arguments (*args).
- Keyword Arguments.
- Arbitrary Keyword Arguments (**kwargs).
- Recursion.
- Function Annotations.
- Closures.
- First-Class Functions.

++Also, we took examples to know how we can use them.

++At the end of the day, we learned about Python Modules and how they can save our time and effort by using the same codes that define functions, classes, and variables in other Python scripts to use their functionality by importing the modules.
