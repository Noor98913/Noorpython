On day 5 of Python training, we discussed data structures and learned how we can use linked list methods in our code to locate data in memory based on the used method.

• prepend(value): Add a new value to the beginning of the list.
• delete(value): Delete the first node with the specified value.
• __len__: Return the number of nodes in the list.
• reverse(): Reverse the list in-place.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Also, we learned about Doubly Linked List:


A doubly linked list is a linked list in which each node has a reference to both the next and the previous node. This allows for more efficient traversal in both directions.

We learned about the below concepts:
 
-Stack:

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Here's an example of a stack:


-Queue:

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Here's an example of a queue:


-Binary Search Tree (BST):

A binary search tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children, and the nodes are ordered in a specific way. 

-Tree Traversal:

Tree traversal is the process of visiting each node in a tree data structure in a specific order.
There are three main types of tree traversal:
    • Inorder: Visit the left subtree, then the root, then the right subtree.
    • Preorder: Visit the root, then the left subtree, then the right subtree.
    • Postorder: Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, then the root.
